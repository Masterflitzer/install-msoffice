# Install Windows and Office

## Windows

1. Create your installation media

## Office

-   Download XML config file from this repository (for Volume Licensing or 365) or generate online with the **Office Customization Tool**: https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings and save it as _odt.xml_ (e.g. `$home/downloads/odt.xml`)

If you want to deploy the beta, change channel in the 2nd line to: `Channel="BetaChannel"`

### Script

-   Download and run the script _odt.ps1_

If your executionpolicy doesn't allow the script, run these commands in PowerShell as Administrator and try again:

-   `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
-   `Unblock-File "$home/downloads/odt.ps1"`

Alternatively run the cmd wrapper _odt.cmd_

### Manual

-   Run it and extract in a directory of your choice (e.g. $home/documents/office-deployment-tool)
-   Open PowerShell and run these commands successively:
    -   `& "$home/documents/office-deployment-tool/setup.exe" /download "$home\downloads\odt.xml"`
    -   `& "$home/documents/office-deployment-tool/setup.exe" /configure "$home\downloads\odt.xml"`

# Notes:
